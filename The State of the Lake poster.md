# The State of the Lake: Water Quality, Land Use, and Algal Blooms in Lake Erie
## Val Masters and Kopo Oromeng, 2017, Oberlin College

Lake Erie provides drinking water to over 11 million people, supports an economy that generates 12 billion dollars a year and over 100,000 jobs. 
This project investigates harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Lake Erie by comparing land use to surface water temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and sediment concentration.
