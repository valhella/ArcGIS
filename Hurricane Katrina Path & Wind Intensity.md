I revised my original map of Hurricane Katrina's path, error, winds, and forecasts. Originally I tried to present too much information on one map. 
For my map revision I took out the forecast lines, since I didn’t think they added much information to a layperson. 
Other major changes involved adding state outlines, decreasing the size and centrality of the legend since it was too prominent, and making the latitude/longitude more readable but minimal (it wasn’t necessary to have them on all four sides). 
I also played with the colors of the map and the transparency in order to make it as clear as possible where the hurricane went and what areas were affected by the different wind speeds. I also adjusted the scale to make it less prominent, and moved the credits off the data area.
